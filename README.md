# TAMPA
Transversal Artificial Meta-Processing Architecture (T.A.M.P.A.) is a canon-first system defining a strict separation between internal truth and external markets. It combines Diets-ordered canonical serialization (DOS-MGC1-v1), Ed25519 verification, and cross-language test vectors to ensure reproducible, tamper-resistant computation.
