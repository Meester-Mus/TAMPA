ci: add GitHub Actions workflow (pytest)

## Summary
This PR adds a GitHub Actions CI workflow that automatically runs pytest on every push and pull request.

## Files Added
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow configuration

## What's Included
The CI workflow includes:
- **Test job**: Runs pytest on push to `main` and `feat/**` branches, and on pull request events
  - Uses Python 3.10
  - Caches pip dependencies for faster builds
  - Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt` (if present)
  - Runs `pytest -q` to execute all tests

- **Lint job (optional)**: Non-blocking linting with flake8
  - Only runs if flake8 is present in requirements.txt
  - Will not fail the workflow (non-blocking by default)
  - Can be configured to fail by removing `|| true` from the flake8 command

## How to Run Tests Locally
To run tests locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
pytest -q
```

## Notes
- The lint job is **non-blocking** by default. If you want linting to fail the build, add `flake8` to `requirements.txt` and remove the `|| true` from the flake8 command in the workflow.
- The workflow uses pip caching to speed up subsequent runs.
- Tests run on `ubuntu-latest` with Python 3.10.
