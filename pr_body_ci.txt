chore(ci): add CI workflow to run pytest

## Summary
This PR adds a GitHub Actions CI workflow that automatically runs pytest on every push and pull request to the main branch.

## Purpose
- Ensure code quality by running automated tests on all changes
- Catch issues early before they are merged into the main branch
- Provide continuous integration for the TAMPA project

## Tests to Run
The CI workflow will execute:
- `pytest -q` to run all unit tests in quiet mode
- Tests will run on `ubuntu-latest` with Python 3.9

## Changes Made
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow configuration

## Testing Instructions
1. Verify the workflow file is present at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
2. Once merged, the workflow will automatically run on push and pull request events to the main branch
3. Check the Actions tab in GitHub to see workflow runs

## Notes
- The workflow uses Python 3.9 as mentioned in the README
- Tests are run with pytest in quiet mode for cleaner output
- No dependencies installation step is included yet (can be added if requirements.txt is present)
